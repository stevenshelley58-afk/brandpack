# Brand Pack - Progress Log

## Completed
- Created `/PROJECT_SPEC.md` as the single source of truth for phases, caps, and validation rules.
- Reconciled architecture, API contract, config schema, and design system docs to match the new spec.
- Realigned `data/config/prompts.json` with the five required calls, validation stack, presets, and evidence policy.

## In Flight
- No active implementation work beyond documentation sync.

## Next Up
- Review adapters and runtime code against the updated spec and config.
- Update automated validation to enforce the new schema if gaps appear.
