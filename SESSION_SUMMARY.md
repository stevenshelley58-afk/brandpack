# Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-01-15  
**Scope**: Documentation and configuration alignment only.

## What Changed
- Authored `/PROJECT_SPEC.md` to define pipeline phases, crawl caps, idea/copy counts, image requirements, presets, and audit rules.
- Rewrote `/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `/docs/API_CONTRACT.md`, `/docs/CONFIG_SCHEMA.md`, and `/docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` to mirror the spec.
- Updated `data/config/prompts.json` with the required five calls, validation stack, and presets (`fast`, `balanced`, `full`).
- Refreshed `PROGRESS.md` to reflect the documentation sync.

## Delta
- `/PROJECT_SPEC.md` is now the authoritative reference.  
- Any discrepancies discovered later should be resolved by updating that spec first, then cascading changes.
